# Simple Notes App

A minimalist, terminal-inspired notes and todo management application with advanced features like card stacking, time tracking, and category-based organization.

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **Quick Note Entry**: Create notes instantly with a terminal-style input prompt
- **Card-Based Display**: Notes appear as draggable cards on a canvas
- **Persistent Storage**: All notes are automatically saved to browser localStorage
- **Fade Animations**: Smooth animations when creating or removing cards

### Advanced Features

#### üé® Color-Coded Categories
Tag your notes with color categories:
- `--k` ‚Üí Turquoise border (e.g., critical tasks)
- `--h` ‚Üí Orange border (e.g., high priority)
- `--p` ‚Üí Violet border (e.g., projects)

**Example:** `Meeting preparation --k`

#### ‚è±Ô∏è Time Tracking
Add time estimates to your notes:
- Format: `15m`, `30m`, `125m` (minutes)
- Time displays in the card header
- Automatic time summation in stacks

**Example:** `Write documentation 60m --p`

#### üìö Card Stacking
- **Drag & Drop**: Drag one card onto another to create a stack
- **Visual Stacking**: Cards stack vertically with a clean offset
- **Smart Ordering**: Last card placed appears on top
- **Total Time**: Stack shows combined time of all cards
- **Auto-Update**: Removing cards automatically recalculates stack time

#### üìä Time Statistics
Header displays real-time statistics:
- **k:** Total time for turquoise cards
- **h:** Total time for orange cards
